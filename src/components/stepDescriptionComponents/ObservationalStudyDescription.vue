    In an observational study, the investigator does not control or assign
    exposure. Instead, they observe and analyze existing exposures or
    interventions that occur naturally, without any interference. Observational
    studies are often used to study associations, trends, or the natural course
    of diseases.

    For example, a researcher conducts a cohort study to investigate the
    association between smoking and lung cancer. The researcher observes
    individuals over time, categorizes them based on their smoking status, and
    analyzes the incidence of lung cancer.
