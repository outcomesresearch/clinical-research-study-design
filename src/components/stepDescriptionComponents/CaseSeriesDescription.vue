    A descriptive study design that involves the detailed analysis of a group of
    patients with similar characteristics or who share a common condition.
    Provides a comprehensive and in-depth description of the clinical
    characteristics, course of disease, and outcomes for the patients included
    in the series. Unlike experimental designs, case series lack a comparison
    group for assessing causation.
