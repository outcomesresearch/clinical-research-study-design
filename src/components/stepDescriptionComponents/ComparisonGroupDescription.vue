    A crucial requirement in assessing the relationship between an exposure or
    intervention and an outcome. The comparison group consists of individuals or
    a cohort of participants who do not have the exposure or intervention of

    effectiveness of a particular treatment or the causal relationship between
    an exposure and outcome.
