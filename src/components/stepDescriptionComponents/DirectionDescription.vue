    The direction of research refers to the temporal relationship between
    exposure and outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cohort studies examine the exposure first and then observe the occurrence of
    the outcome over time, aligning with the clinical pathway for inferring
    causality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cohort studies provide more robust evidence of causality compared to
    case-control studies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding the direction of events helps avoid reverse causation, where
    the outcome influences the exposure. For instance, in a study linking high
    coffee consumption and sleep problems, reverse causation could occur if
    individuals consume more coffee to counteract existing sleep problems. To
    establish causality, the exposure should precede the outcome in time.
